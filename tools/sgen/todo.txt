- add a type_signature() function to Node
    - figure out what statements should return
- all nodes should return a type()
- should have a decl_type
- fix memory leaks in parser.y (use a variant for the union)
- figure out what the generated code should look like / do
    - top-down interface is probably the most important facet
    - could copy nlohmann
