- Add an `OperationImpl<T>` intermediate class so we can do factory construction with perfect forwarding.
- Make `RegionDriver::poll_op_` a `Ptr<PollMultishotOperation>`. I _think_ it should be safe.
- Remove `core.h`, `system.h`, etc.
- Make the `Application` do signal handling.
    - Define an interrupt the application can use to cancel a thread's root task.

- Improve the concept of an executor's budget.
    - Datastructure for the current loop iteration? Frame?

- Loop needs to shut everything down. Can't finalize in the destructor.
