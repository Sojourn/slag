- Add an `OperationImpl<T>` intermediate class so we can do factory construction with perfect forwarding.
- Remove `core.h`, `system.h`, etc.
- Make the `Application` do signal handling.
    - Define an interrupt the application can use to cancel a thread's root task.

- Improve the concept of an executor's budget.
    - Datastructure for the current loop iteration? Frame?

- Rename core to sched or something

- Thread spawning should wait until the root task has been initialized, and propagate exceptions from it.
