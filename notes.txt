Pointers to deltas w/ background merging.
  - Works really well with a coil design.
Hybrid hot/cold with a bloom filter on top.
  - Cold on-disk, hot in-memory?

WAL of logical pointer table updates?

// ring buffer that posts 'slabs' of messages
// allows the ring size to flex
// interrupts to wake receiving thread
// include a sequence or something to protect against drops

// Tasks, Task Groups, and Operations should automatically schedule themselves.

// Think about giving operations priorities. Probably want to submit high priority operations before low priority ones.
